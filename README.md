# ClashRoyaleAPIExample
Practice project to create a news portal for the popular mobile game 'Clash Royale'..includes a little profile viewer using the officialClash royale API...... WIP

*GO TO THE VIEW YOUR PROFILE LINK TO CHECK A FEW STATS OF ANYONES PROFILE (Provided you have their tag) AND TO SEE WHAT I THINK ABOUT THEM ~_^*

Update: 
Implemented Clash Royale API with Vanilla JS

How to Use : 
1- Get your own jwt token from the official developer website of clash royale https://developer.clashroyale.com/#/
2- Replace the dummy key value of 'api_key' in app.js with your new key from the official website
3- Recent chrome Updates have made it impossible to hit API auth requests with browser because of the new CORS policy
4- A workaround would be to use an all security stripped instance of chrome purely for dev/testing purpose
5- You can create such an instance of chrome with a few steps which are detailed in the video below

REMEMBER TO USE THIS CHROME INSTANCE ONLY FOR DEV/TESTING PURPOSE AND NOT FOR CASUAL BROWSING

6- Once you setup the no-security chrome, you can open your localhost in there and fire the API without the annoying CORS error
